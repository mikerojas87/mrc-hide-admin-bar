# MRC Hide Admin Bar

## What is this?

This is a simple WordPress plugin that does exactly what the title says... Hides the Admin Bar.

## How do I use this?

To get started upload to your /plugins directory then activate via the plugins list page in wp-admin. To "un-hide" the admin bar simply deactivate this plugin. Dont worry you can do this as many times as you need.

## Notes...

Right now th plugin is stupid simple. over time I plan to add features that include limiting to roles and or capabilities, adding custom admin bars, and a toggle rather than activeating and deactivating this plugin.
